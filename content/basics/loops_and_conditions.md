```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(f"Square of {i} is {i**2}")
```

    Square of 1 is 1
    Square of 2 is 4
    Square of 3 is 9
    Square of 4 is 16
    Square of 5 is 25
    


```python
n = 5
while n > 0:
    if n % 2 == 0:
        print(n, "is even")
    else:
        print(n, "is odd")
    n -= 1
```

    5 is odd
    4 is even
    3 is odd
